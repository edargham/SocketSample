# TCP Socket Sample Appliction
Client/Server Socket application using .NET Core to be used as reference for future applications.
---

## About
This Client/Server application's intended purpose is to be coupled and easily integrated into other C# .NET projects that require a transport level Client/Server connection.
The project is still a work in progress with a huge room for improvement, however it has reached a point where it could be easily reused and extended.

## Features
* Both JSON and XML serialization are supported and implemented.
* Ability to extend the base classes to support other serialization methods.
* Channel Routing
* Channel Throttling
* Connection Limiting

## Roadmap
* Optimizations at the Action Binding level.
* Server-side Messaging.
* Abstraction at the level of handler task implementation.
